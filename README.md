We developed a BLE-based system that estimates distance using the following model:

```
distance (m) = 10 ^ ((txPower - RSSI) / (10 * n))
```

This model provides reasonably accurate distance estimates in indoor environments.

### Results

* **Stable estimation** within 1â€“5 meters.
* **LED control** based on estimated distance was successful.
* **web server** display on web with estimated distance.

### Evaluation

* **Accuracy**: Acceptable for short-range proximity detection.
* **Limitation**: Accuracy drops with obstacles or signal reflection.

It shows pretty well result.

so we can control LED light with estimated distance
